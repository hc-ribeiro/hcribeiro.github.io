### Bussines Reports at Banco do Brasil

As a full stack and solo developer, I designed and implemented a reporting system for the regional business superintendence at Banco do Brasil. The solution automated web scraping tasks using Selenium (Java) to collect data from both internal and external sources, generated custom reports, and stored them in MySQL. These reports were published on an internal website built with JQuery (JavaScript), Bootstrap (CSS), and Java with JSF. I was responsible for configuring and maintaining the entire stack on a VPS, ensuring reliable operation.

### Bank Fees at Banco do Brasil
As a member of the agile team maintaining the Bank Fees system, I developed user interfaces for both web (Angular) and mobile (React Native) platforms, serving employees and customers. Additionally, I was responsible for implementing Java-based integrations with the Mainframe Platform, exposing REST APIs to support seamless communication between the interfaces and backend systems.

### Custom Dental Products Order System at Blue Aligner

As a full stack and solo developer, I designed and implemented an order management system for Blue Aligner, enabling the sale of custom dental products through https://sistema.bluealigner.com.br/. The platform was built from the ground up as a single-page application using Vue.js, with a backend composed of Symfony (PHP) and Quarkus (Java) microservices, and MySQL for data persistence. Key integrations include AWS S3 for file storage, the ASaaS payment API, and the Brazilian Postal Service (Correios) for shipping management. I was solely responsible for creating and maintaining the CI/CD pipeline, initially deploying services on AWS, with some components later migrated to Google Cloud Platform.

### Brave Cloud Platform at Banco do Brasil

As a member of the agile team maintaining an internal cloud console platform for Banco do Brasil developers, I was responsible for developing user interfaces, initially in React, later migrating to a microfrontend architecture with Angular. I also implemented integrations with the Kubernetes API and developer tools such as GitHub and GitLab, using a microservices architecture with Quarkus (Java) and Node.js, for the persistence we used a mix of MongoDB and Oracle. As the project evolved, I took on the role of technical lead, defining architures, assisting other developers and supporting the product owner in backlog planning and user story refinement.
